DEBUG: Possible options found for libcudart.so: set()
CUDA SETUP: PyTorch settings found: CUDA_VERSION=126, Highest Compute Capability: 8.6.
CUDA SETUP: To manually override the PyTorch CUDA version please see:https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/blob/main/how_to_use_nonpytorch_cuda.md
CUDA SETUP: Required library version not found: libbitsandbytes_cuda126.so. Maybe you need to compile it from source?
CUDA SETUP: Defaulting to libbitsandbytes_cpu.so...

================================================ERROR=====================================
CUDA SETUP: CUDA detection failed! Possible reasons:
1. You need to manually override the PyTorch CUDA version. Please see: "https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/blob/main/how_to_use_nonpytorch_cuda.md
2. CUDA driver not installed
3. CUDA not installed
4. You have multiple conflicting CUDA libraries
5. Required library not pre-compiled for this bitsandbytes release!
CUDA SETUP: If you compiled from source, try again with `make CUDA_VERSION=DETECTED_CUDA_VERSION` for example, `make CUDA_VERSION=113`.
CUDA SETUP: The CUDA version for the compile might depend on your conda install. Inspect CUDA version via `conda list | grep cuda`.
================================================================================

CUDA SETUP: Problem: The main issue seems to be that the main CUDA runtime library was not detected.
CUDA SETUP: Solution 1: To solve the issue the libcudart.so location needs to be added to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable
CUDA SETUP: Solution 1a): Find the cuda runtime library via: find / -name libcudart.so 2>/dev/null
CUDA SETUP: Solution 1b): Once the library is found add it to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:FOUND_PATH_FROM_1a
CUDA SETUP: Solution 1c): For a permanent solution add the export from 1b into your .bashrc file, located at ~/.bashrc
CUDA SETUP: Solution 2: If no library was found in step 1a) you need to install CUDA.
CUDA SETUP: Solution 2a): Download CUDA install script: wget https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/blob/main/cuda_install.sh
CUDA SETUP: Solution 2b): Install desired CUDA version to desired location. The syntax is bash cuda_install.sh CUDA_VERSION PATH_TO_INSTALL_INTO.
CUDA SETUP: Solution 2b): For example, "bash cuda_install.sh 113 ~/local/" will download CUDA 11.3 and install into the folder ~/local
CUDA SETUP: Setup Failed!

RuntimeError: 
        CUDA Setup failed despite GPU being available. Please run the following command to get more information:

        python -m bitsandbytes

        Inspect the output of the command and see if you can locate CUDA libraries. You might need to add them
        to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If you suspect a bug, please take the information from python -m bitsandbytes

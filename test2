ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
unsloth 2025.6.12 requires bitsandbytes, which is not installed.
xformers 0.0.30 requires torch==2.7.0, but you have torch 2.5.1+cu121 which is incompatible.
